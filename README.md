# Contact Centers Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA)

This is the OPL model which compares different contact centers (DMUs) with each other based on inputs recieved (Calls Received) vs outputs (Calls Answered) and a series of KPIs and constraints which a typical contact center has. The DEA model is the dual of the primary model as it is easier to form and explain to the business users.
